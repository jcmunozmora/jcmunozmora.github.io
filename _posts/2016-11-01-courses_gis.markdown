In this course, we introduce students to the basic tools to analyze, create and manipulate different types of datasets from Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The aim of the course is to provide students with a basic knowledge to master the spatial data analysis toolbox, which offers alternative solutions to a broad range of empirical problems of applied economics. It is a practical course in which students are required to have an active participation through practices during lectures and problem sets. We will explore the basic GIS Desktop tools (i.e. ArcGIS and QGIS) as well as some GIS applications in standard statistic packages (Stata and R). However, an especial emphasis will be placed on building standalone solution based on Python (e.g. GDAL, FIONA, among others).
