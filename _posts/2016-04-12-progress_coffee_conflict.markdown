This paper explores the relationship between armed internal conflict and agricultural production, using the case of the Colombian coffee sector. After being many years out of conflict, coffee producer regions in Colombia were exposed to violence as a consequences of the intensification of conflict during nineties and the deteriorate of the world coffee market. By using unique census data sets from two different years (1997 and 2005), we propose two approaches to estimate the actual relationship between coffee and violence. First, we explore how conflict generates disincentives to continue on agricultural production. Second, we examine the direct impact of conflict on agricultural production through different productive outcomes. We find a significant negative relationship between levels of violence and the decision to continue coffee production as well as the levels of productivity of the coffee production to coffee. Results are robust after controlling for sample selection bias and after several specifications.
