This chapter studies we seek to measure the effect that the Colombian internal armed conflict has had during the last decade on the country's distribution of land. Our main finding is that, in the period between 2000 and 2009, land concentration became even more pronounced, reaching a Gini coefficient of 0.86 in 2009, which is one of the highest in the world. We find statistical correlation between higher land concentration and armed actions, but they are hesitant to attribute a causal relationship: it may be that the conflict creates higher inequality by displacing smallholders and facilitating the accumulation of plots in a few hands, but it may also be that areas with highly concentrated land tend to be particularly attractive to armed actors. A second important finding in our analysis is that past land concentration is the main predictor of current concentration. Path-dependency, then, is crucial for explaining current levels of inequality. As they show in the first section of our chapter, a highly unequal distribution of land already existed in colonial times, and tended to increase during the first century of the independent republic. Despite a few attempted land reforms in the twentieth century, unequal distribution has never been seriously transformed.
