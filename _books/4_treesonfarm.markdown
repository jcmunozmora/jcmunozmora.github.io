# Do Trees on Farms Matter in African Agriculture?

Common wisdom: Trees on farms are not important in Sub-Saharan African agriculture.

Main findings:
  - With about a third of smallholder farmers reporting cultivating trees on their farms, trees are not uncommon in the five Sub-Saharan African countries studied. Fruit trees and tree cash crops (such as coffee, cacao, and cashew nuts) are the most frequent tree categories grown.
  - The prevalence of on-farm trees for timber is also sizable in Tanzania (18 percent of smallholders), but minimal or poorly recorded elsewhere.
  - In addition to sales, fruit trees are also commonly used for self-consumption in Ethiopia and Uganda, implying that they may play an important role in food security and nutrition.
  - Their contribution to income is not negligible—17 percent of total gross income among tree crop growers, and 6 percent on average across all rural households.
  - Tree-growing households are better off on average in most of the study countries.
  - Trees are more likely on larger farms, in warmer areas, and closer to forests. Their prevalence also appears to be shaped by national policies and institutional factors.
