This paper analyzes the impact of an increase in the armed conflict on agricultural production using the case of the Colombian coffee sector. I exploit a natural experiment which caused the level of violence to vary significantly due to the unexpected rupture of the peace dialogues between the Colombian government and the FARC in 2002. Using data provided by the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia, I estimate the Intention to Treat (ITT) using a Difference-in-Difference approach. Results suggest that an exogenous increase in the levels of violence induced a reduction of hectares allocated to coffee of -0.06 Ha on average. Moreover, on an average farm (2 ha of land allocated to coffee), an exogenous increase in  the levels of violence decreased the sowing of new coffee by 3.5%. This paper contributes to the literature on the microeconomics costs of conflict in agricultural production, providing further information on the mechanisms behind the effects (labor market).
