Trees on farms are often overlooked in agricultural and natural resource research and policy in Sub-Saharan Africa.  is paper addresses this gap using data from the Living Standards Measurement Study–Integrated Surveys on Agriculture in  five countries: Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda. Trees on farms are widespread. On average, one third of rural smallholders grow trees.They account for an average of 17 percent of total annual gross income for tree-growing households and 6 percent for all rural households. Gender, land and labor endowments, and especially forest proximity and national context are key determinants of on-farm tree adoption and management. These new, national-scale insights on the prevalence, economic contribution and determinants of trees on farms in Africa lay the basis for exploring the interaction of agriculture, on-farm tree cultivation, and forestry.  is will improve our understanding of rural livelihood dynamics
