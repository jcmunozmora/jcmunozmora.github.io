This article explores the relationship between armed conflict and changes in land tenure in the region of Urabá, a northwestern Colombian region considered as one of the main center of the intensification of Colombian conflict during eighties and nineties. We use a multi-method methodological approach. First, using qualitative instruments applied to the main actors present in the region, we build an understanding of the territorial disputes, actors and mechanisms used to transfer land in Urabá during the last 50 years. Eight land transfer mechanisms were identified: (i) colonization; (ii) public land titles; (iii) land market; (iv) invasions; (v) repopulation; (vi) material dispossession; (vii) forced sale; and (viii) forgery and identity theft. In each period of violence, illegal actors used these mechanisms to increase military, social and political control over the population. These qualitative findings allow us to have a clear spatial and temporal distribution of the different territorial disputes, where actors applied systematically different mechanism of land transfer that might have affected the land tenure structure. We use a unique dataset of rural plot ownership in 2011, based on cadastral information gathered by the regional government, to test quantitatively this hypothesis. A fixed effects model of land tenure structure is estimated to approach the relationship between land tenure and conflict in Urabá. The main empirical finding is that territories under dispute and under predominant paramilitary control had both larger plots and less land transfers. In contrast, territories with low levels of conflict have a small landholders scheme. These results are an important technical support for an ongoing process of transitional justice in Colombia based on land restitution.
