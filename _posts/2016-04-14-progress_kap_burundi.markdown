Quantifying the level of Attitude-Behavior consistency is one of the rationales behind the progressive incorporation of attitudinal questions in childcare-related survey questionnaires. We argue that the questionnaire design, and in particular the order and timing of questions on attitudes (attitudes toward a behavior) and practices (behavioral intentions), may entail different strength of cognitive dissonance, thereby biasing the estimated level of unobservable “true consistency” in an asymmetric way. In a Randomize Control Trial (RCT) we run in Burundi, a sample of household is randomly treated with four different KAP designs: (i) Questions on practices precede questions on attitudes within the same subsection (control group); (ii) Questions on attitudes precede questions on practices within the same subsection (control group. (Treatment I); (iii) Questions on practices precede questions on attitudes in different subsections (treatment II); and, (iv) Questions on attitudes precede questions on practices in different subsections (treatment III). The most important result is that behavioral self-reports predict attitudinal self-reports more than the opposite independently of the timing imposed by the questionnaire. Higher aggregate consonance induced by behavioral questions suggests that the strength of attitudes is relatively weak in the specific context of rural Burundi. We offer a cognitive-dissonance reduction based explanation, but low accessibility of the studied attitudes in the memory, low frequency at which they are evoked or low extent to which they are grounded in direct experience are also compatible with the described effect. Several alternative inference specifications are presented and encompass various level of aggregation. The implications for KAP survey design are discussed.
