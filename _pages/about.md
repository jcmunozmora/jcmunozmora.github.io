I am a development economist specializing in rural development, impact evaluation, and data science for applied economics. My expertise lies in understanding the dynamics of economic development and finding effective strategies to promote sustainable growth in vulnerables societies. I am passionate about using mixed method evidence-based approaches to inform policy decisions and drive positive change.

I believe that development should be inclusive and equitable, empowering communities to become self-sufficient and fostering economic opportunities for all. My work is guided by the principles of social justice and sustainable development, aiming to create a better future for individuals and societies.

I am professor of Development Economics and Chair of Policy and Development at Universidad EAFIT-Colombia. I'm also research associated at [Institute of Development Studies (UK)](https://www.ids.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}.
